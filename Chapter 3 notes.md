# Chapter 3 / Swift for Object-Oriented App Development

- Classes contain _properties_ and _methods_
- Properties = variables that are part of a class
- Methods = functions that are part of a class
- "Object" = instance of a class

- Initializers (aka `init`)
 - "designated initializers": sets up everything needed to use object
 - "convenience initializers": exists to make setting up instances easy (aka "convenient"), and calls a designated initializer as part of its setup
- Deinitializer (aka `deinit`)
 - run code when object is going away

- classes store data in _properties_
- Swift allows inheritance from a single parent class

- Computed Properties

- Observers

- Lazy Properties

- Protocols
 - look like a Class, but no actual code provided (just define what kind of properties and functions exist, how they're accessed)

- Extensions _extend_ existing types (add additional methods and computed properties)
 - can be own classes, or _any_ type (ex: Int, String)

- Access Control
 - Public / Internal / Private
 - ex: visible (can be accessed) within only its source file, or entire app

- Operator Overloading

- Generics: see Playground üéâ

- Subscripts

- Structures: related to classes, but not the same
  - no inheritance
  - when passed around via code, a structure is _copied_

- Modules

- Foundation, Cocoa, Cocoa Touch, and the Swift Standard Library
  - `import Cocoa` or `import UIKit`

- Data: aka `NSData`

- Error Handling

- Memory Management
  - _memory managed_
  - _reference counting_ = technique Swift uses to keep track of which objects are being used and which are not
  - _weak references_ = object needs not stay in memory

- Design Patterns in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
  - Model-View-Controller (MVC)
  - Delegation pattern
  - Notifications

- Model-View-Controller
  - _Models_ = objects storing data
  - _Views_ = objects working with user
  - _Controllers_ = objects mediating between _models_ and _views_; "business logic"

- Delegation
  - ‚ÄúDelegation is Cocoa‚Äôs term for passing off some responsibilities of an object to another.‚Äù

- Structuring an app
  - _event-driven programming_
  - "application delegate" aka _app delegate_
  - Window controllers (macOS) and View Controllers (iOS)
  - Nibs and Storyboards
